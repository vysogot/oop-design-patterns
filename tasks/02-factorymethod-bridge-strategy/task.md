## Client
We are looking for a software developer to design and implement a game character creator. This character creator will be used in a role-playing game, where players can create and customize their characters.

The character creator should have the following functionalities:
1. Ability to create different types of characters such as warrior, mage, archer.
2. Ability for characters to switch between different abilities during gameplay.
3. Store character type and current ability.
4. Ability to retrieve the character type and current ability.

## Coding Task: Implement a Game Character Creator
Use the following object-oriented patterns to design and implement a game character creator:
* Factory Method: Design a CharacterFactory class to create different types of characters (e.g. warrior, mage, archer) using the factory method pattern.
* Bridge: Implement a CharacterAbilities class to bridge the gap between the character type and their abilities (e.g. fireball, arrow shot, sword strike).
* Strategy: Design the CharacterAbilities class to use the strategy pattern to allow characters to switch between different abilities during gameplay.

### Implement the following functionalities in the CharacterFactory class:
* Create different types of characters (warrior, mage, archer).
* Provide a method to retrieve the created characters.

### Implement the following functionalities in the CharacterAbilities class:

* Provide a method to retrieve the current ability of a character.

### Implement the following functionalities in the Character class:
* Store the character type and current ability.
* Provide methods to retrieve the character type and current ability.

### Notes:
* You can use any programming language of your choice to implement the solution.
* You may use any data structure or library for storing the characters and abilities, but make sure to implement the data structure or library yourself.

### Deliverables:
* Source code.
* A brief explanation of the solution.
* A test plan and test results.
